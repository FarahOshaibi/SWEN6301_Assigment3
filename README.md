Question

Design a few classes which relate to a one concept as follows:

At least two classes that define an inheritance relation from a base class. The base class could be an interface or abstract class.
At least one class that defines an interface.
Two examples of polymorphim.
One example of data coupling.
One example of stamp coupling.

Discusion 

Inheritance from Interface (implements)

Shape_Interface is the Interface.
Classes (Rectangle & Triangle) are implements From the Interface (Shape_Interface)
in sub class make @override for all abstarct method in basic class.
Main class use to call method in other class this define data coupling
